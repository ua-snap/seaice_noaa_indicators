The indicators variables in this dataset we defined as follows:

Freeze-up Start
    Valid date range: 9/1 - 1/31
    Threshold: sum of mean and standard deviation of daily summer sea ice concentration (SIC), with a minimum of 15%
    Definition: day-of-year of first day the daily SIC exceeds the threshold
    Undefined if:
        a. daily SIC never exceeds this threshold
        b. mean summer SIC is > 25%
        c. subsequent Freeze-up End is not defined 

Freeze-up End
    Valid date range: 9/1 - 2/28
    Threshold: mean SIC in winter minus 10%, with a minimum of 15% and a maximum or 50%
    Definition: day-of-year of the first day after the Freeze-up Start date where the daily SIC exceeds the threshold for the following two weeks
    Undefined if: 
        a. daily SIC is above this threshold for every day of the search period
        b. Freeze-up Start is not defined

Break-up Start
    Valid date range: 2/1 - 7/30
    Threshold: mean winter SIC minus 2 standard deviations of the winter SIC, with a minimum of 15%
    Definition: day-of-year of the last day for which previous two weeks of the daily SIC exceeds this threshold
    Undefined if: 
        a. mean summer SIC is greater than 40% 
        b. subsequent Break-up end is not defined

Break-up End
    Valid date range: 2/1 - 9/29
    Threshold: sum of the mean and standard deviation of daily summer SIC, with a minimum of 50%
    Definition: day-of-year of the first day after Break-up Start where the daily SIC is less than the threshold for the following two weeks
    Undefined if:
        a. daily SIC is less than the threshold for every day of the search period 
        b. Break-up Start is not defined
